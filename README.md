## Problem Title
SIH 1555: Create a Virtual Herbal Garden that provides an interactive, educational, and immersive experience to users, showcasing the diverse range of medicinal plants used in AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy).
## Problem Description
Background: The AYUSH sector relies heavily on medicinal plants and herbs, which form the backbone of traditional healing practices. However, physical gardens that are not accessible to everyone. A Virtual Herbal Garden will bridge this gap by offering a digital platform where users can explore, learn, and understand the significance of various medicinal plants from the comfort of their homes. Description: Participants are tasked with developing a Virtual Herbal Garden that is engaging, informative, and user-friendly. This virtual garden should include: Interactive 3D Models: Realistic 3D models of medicinal plants that users can rotate, zoom, and explore from different angles. Detailed Information: Comprehensive details about each plant, including its botanical name, common names, habitat, medicinal uses, and methods of cultivation. Multimedia Integration: High-quality images, videos, and audio descriptions to enhance the learning experience. Search and Filter Options: Advanced search functionality to easily locate specific plants and filter them based on various criteria like medicinal uses, region, and type. Virtual Tours: Guided virtual tours highlighting specific themes, such as plants for digestive health, immunity, skin care, etc. User Interaction: Features that allow users to bookmark favourite plants, take notes, and share information on social media. Expected Outcome: The expected outcome is a comprehensive Virtual Herbal Garden that serves as a valuable educational tool for students, practitioners, and enthusiasts of the AYUSH sector. This platform should make the knowledge of medicinal plants accessible to a wider audience, promoting awareness and understanding of traditional herbal practices. It should be visually appealing, informative, and interactive, providing users with an immersive experience that combines technology with traditional knowledge.

## Idea
### Challenge Statement:
Design and develop an engaging, educational, and immersive Virtual Herbal Garden that highlights a wide variety of medicinal plants used across AYUSH systems (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy).

### Background:
The AYUSH system heavily relies on medicinal plants for traditional treatments. However, physical herbal gardens are limited in accessibility. A digital alternative—a Virtual Herbal Garden—will help bridge this accessibility gap, allowing users to explore and learn about these plants from anywhere.

### Objective:
Create an intuitive and interactive virtual platform that educates users about medicinal herbs through 3D models, multimedia content, and user-friendly tools.


## Key Features:
### Interactive 3D Models: 
Realistic, rotatable, and zoomable plant models.

### Informative Content: 
Botanical details, common/local names, growth conditions, healing properties, and cultivation methods.

### Multimedia Support: 
Incorporation of images, explanatory videos, and audio guides to enrich learning.

### Advanced Search & Filters: 
Find plants based on health benefits, regions, or categories.

### Guided Virtual Tours: 
Thematic tours such as "Herbs for Immunity" or "Skin Wellness".

### User Engagement Tools: 
Save favorites, take personal notes, and share findings on social media.

### Responsive Interface: 
Seamless usage across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

### AR/VR Compatibility (Future Scope): 
Enhance immersion using Augmented or Virtual Reality.


## Proposed Solution / Architecture Diagram
We propose a Virtual Herbal Garden Platform that enables users to explore medicinal plants interactively through a web and mobile-based application. The solution will include:

3D Plant Visualization: Realistic models that users can rotate, zoom, and inspect.

Educational Content: Detailed info about each plant—scientific names, medicinal uses, habitat, etc.

Virtual Tours: Curated tours on themes like “Immunity Boosters” or “Skin Remedies.”

Search & Filter: Advanced search based on symptoms, plant type, region, etc.

Multimedia Learning: High-quality images, audio, and videos for each plant.

User Features: Bookmarking, note-taking, sharing on social media.

Responsive Design: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

## Use Cases
Student Learning
Students of botany, Ayurveda, and life sciences can use the platform for self-paced exploration of medicinal plants.

Healthcare Practitioners
Ayurvedic/Unani/Homeopathy practitioners can use the garden as a reference tool.

General Public Awareness
People interested in traditional healing and home remedies can learn about herbs and their uses.

School Integration
Schools and colleges can use the virtual garden for educational tours in their digital curriculum.

Social Media Sharing
Users can share interesting plant facts with others to promote wider awareness.
